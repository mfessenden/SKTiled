/// The `DebugDrawOptions` structure represents debug drawing options for **SKTiled** objects.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // show the map's grid & bounds shape
/// tilemap.debugDrawOptions = [.drawGrid, .drawFrame]
///
/// // turn off layer grid visibility
/// layer.debugDrawOptions.remove(.drawGrid)
/// ```
///
/// ### Properties
///
/// - `drawGrid`: visualize the nodes's tile grid.
/// - `drawFrame`: visualize the nodes's bounding rect.
/// - `drawGraph`: visualize the nodes's pathfinding graph.
/// - `drawObjectFrames`: draw object's bounding shapes.
/// - `drawAnchor`: draw the layer's anchor point.           
///
