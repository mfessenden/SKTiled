/// The `TilesetDataSource` protocol outlines methods which allow the user to dynamically alter the properties of a tileset as it is being created.
///
/// ### Instance Methods
///
/// Delegate callbacks are called asynchronously as the tileset is being rendered.
///
/// - `willAddSpriteSheet`: Provide an image name for the tileset before textures are generated.
/// - `willAddImage`: Provide an alernate image name for an image in a collection.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// Implementing the `TilesetDataSource.willAddSpriteSheet` method allows the user to specify different spritesheet images. Take care
/// that these images have the same dimensions & layout.
///
/// ```swift
/// extension MyScene: TilesetDataSource {
///     func willAddSpriteSheet(to tileset: SKTileset, fileNamed: String) -> String {
///         if (currentSeason == .winter) {
///             return "winter-tiles-16x16.png"
///         }
///         if (currentSeason == .summer) {
///             return "summer-tiles-16x16.png"
///         }
///         return fileNamed
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - tileset: Tileset instance.
    ///   - fileNamed: Spritesheet name.
    /// - Returns:  Spritesheet name.

    /// Provide an alernate image name for an image in a collection tileset. Implement this method to allow remapping of images *before* the tileset is created.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - tileset: Tileset instance.
    ///   - forId: Tile id.
    ///   - fileNamed: Image name.
    /// - Returns:  Image name.
